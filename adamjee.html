<h2 >Browse Best Motor Insurance Plan to Make Your Road Journey Safe</h2>
<p>Motor insurance is a coverage which is bought for cars, trucks and other vehicles that ply on roads. Its main objective is to give complete protection against physical damage or loss from natural and man-made calamities. In India, motor insurance is mandatory to ply a vehicle on road.</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motor Insurance can be broadly classified under below heads: </span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Car Insurance</strong>: Car Insurance gives coverage against accidental loss or damages to own car or to a third party. While choosing a car insurance policy, a person should always compare premium offered by various insurers to ensure that he got the best deal. The amount of premium would depend on the make &amp; value of car, state from where it is registered and manufacturing year.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Two Wheeler Insurance</strong>: It provides protection to bikes and scooters. The features of two wheeler policy are similar to car insurance.</li>
</ul>
