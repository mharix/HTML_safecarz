<p>Let us discuss each in detail:</p>
<h2><strong>Comprehensive and Liability Only Covers</strong></h2>
<p>One can choose between the coverage they want. The liability-only policy is required under Indian law and each motor bike needs to have at least that two wheeler policy to guard against accountabilities, and personal insurance. This bike insurance also provides insurance against wear and tears to the two-wheeler and also provides personal accident cover for the co- riders (generally as an add-on cover).</p>
<h3><strong>Instant Policy</strong></h3>
<p>In the earlier days, customers buying or renewing a two wheeler policy would get a cover note and not the policy itself. The main bike insurance policy document was mailed to them at their address at a later date. With the emergence of new technology and faster banking facilities, a digitally signed policy is nowadays issued immediately to the policyholder.</p>
<h3><strong>Optional Covers</strong></h3>
<p>These include personal accident cover for pillion riders, enhanced cover for spare parts and accessories, Zero Dep cover and so on. The additional coverage is generally offered at a slightly extra cost but go a long way to ease the claim bike insurance process in case of happening of an unforeseen or unfortunate event and filing a two wheeler policy claim is mandatory.</p>
<h3><strong>Easy Transfer of No Claim Bonus (NCB)</strong></h3>
<p>The insurance companies offer easy transfer of the NCB discount if the person buys a new vehicle. The NCB is given to the driver/owner and not to the vehicle. The easy transfer option means that the person is rewarded for safe driving practices and for not making a two wheeler policy claim in the earlier year(s).</p>
<h3><strong>Discounts</strong></h3>
<p>IRDA approved insurers provide discounts for certain factors such as membership of a recognized automotive association, discount for vehicles that have approved anti-theft devices, etc. Owners with an unblemished record also receive concessions in NCB (no claim bonus).</p>
<h3><strong>Two-Wheeler Insurance Renewal or Purchase Online</strong></h3>
<p>The insurance companies offer online purchase or policy renewal through their websites and sometimes even through mobile apps. This makes it easy for the policy owner to get their needs fulfilled. Since all prior two wheeler policy claim or additional details are already in the database, the bike insurance renewal process is quick and highly convenient for the customer.</p>

<h2><a>Types of Two Wheeler Insurance</a></h2>
<div>
<p>The most common classification of vehicle insurance, including the two-wheeler type is according to the type of cover provided to the insured. Policies in this sense are generally of two types: comprehensive policy and liability only insurance policy. The Indian Motor Vehicles Act makes it mandatory for all automobiles that ply on public areas to have third-party insurance.</p>
<p> This means that any mechanized vehicle that is running on Indian roads such as cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, etc. need to have this insurance at the very least. However, with the advantages this motor insurance offers, they have become a clear favorite among the Indian public.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Two Wheeler Insurance</strong></p>
<p>The comprehensive two wheeler insurance, as the name suggest, provide total cover for the two-wheeler and the insured. It provides four-way insurance:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Protects from losses due to damages to the vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>These wear and tears may be due to man-made reasons or due to natural causes. Whatever the reason, these help the insured to meet the wears and tears suffered by the two-wheeler and gets it back running into its original condition in no time at all. Most insurance companies offer additional add-on or optional features that help to further insure them any losses. Optional features like zero depreciation even helps to save against costs from consumables, if the option is chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Personal accident cover</strong></h3>
<p>Offer a personal accident cover up to Rs. 1 lakh to insure against any injuries that result in partial or total temporary or permanent disability or even death. The Indian motor insurance companies offer the optional benefit to add co-passenger. Companies also include this cover in their liability only policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Insures against third party liability</strong></h3>
<p>Guard against any cause of action arising due to this liability. These legal responsibilities may arise due to:</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Bodily injury to or death</strong></h3>
<p>Protect against any wears and tears that may accrue due to injuries to or even death. These injuries may result in hospitalization and may be ones that cause temporary or permanent damage or partial or total loss of limbs or their functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Damages to third party property</strong></h3>
<p>The insurance companies cover this loss only up to a specific limit as defined under the policy document.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Liability Only Policy</strong></h2>
<p>The two-wheeler liability only covers insure against legal responsibilities due to injuries suffered by anyone in the surroundings or losses suffered by them solely due to the unfortunate event. As the name suggests, these types of plans do not safeguard against wears and tears suffered by the vehicle.</p>
<p>Most motor insurance companies in India may also provide a personal accident cover for the owner of the motorcycle, moped or scooty. Some IRDA approved insurers also offer multi-year accountability only plans that can cover the vehicle for 2 to 3 years.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><a>Why is Two Wheeler Insurance Policy Required</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Indian laws mandate that any vehicle plying on all public roads in the country should have third-party insurance. Even though the laws do not prescribe comprehensive cover, the nature of costs that arise from a mishap or other man-made or natural events necessitate that owners opt for some sort of comprehensive insurance that protects against wear and tears to the vehicle and the riders in addition to securing against wears and tears. The motor insurance laws in India protect the millions of owners in India from any large costs that may arise due to wears and tears to their motorcycle, scooty, or moped.</p>
<p> Anybody travelling on Indian roads would have seen the unceasing growth in the number of automobiles in the country. The lack of good roads, the morning and evening rush hours, and unregulated traffic problems are a part and parcel of life today. In addition, events such as rainfall or snow, or heat waves may cause problems on the road such as slippery surfaces, mushy or muddy areas, or sticky tar that may cause damages to the vehicle and even injure the riders.  Other man-made events or natural disasters add their own range of problems that may damage the vehicle or result in various types of costs and other legal responsibilities. All these costs and legal responsibilities can be easily countered by a policy.  This policy helps in a number of ways: They protect against wears and tears to the scooter, motorbike, or moped. The machines that run on the road today are a far cry from the ones that used to ply on the roads a few years ago. Advances in technology, environmental laws and restrictions and the demand for the best vehicles possible has meant that Indian two-wheeled automobiles are now much more advanced in terms of engine specs, rider comfort, overall ride quality and looks.  These advances also mean the cost of automobiles has gone up along with the cost of their spare parts. Even the simple nuts and bolts or parts such as the gears or the brake pads are now costlier than before. Even a small damage can result in a bill of thousands of rupees in terms of repair costs.  As most of the two-wheeler riders are middle class consumers, a small damage can cause a huge dent in their savings and can even skew an entire year’s financial planning. All this can be avoided with a valid policy. These plans will help the insured to get the scooter, motorbike, moped repaired without creating a hole in their wallets. A two wheeler insurance policy in India guards against both man-made events as well as natural disasters.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Two-Wheeler Insurance against damage or loss to the vehicle due to man-made reasons</strong></h3>
<p>Insurance companies offer a range of man-made reasons against which they offer protection to the insured party. These include unforeseen events, such as burglary, theft, riot, and the strike by outside means, malicious act, terrorist activity, and any damage in transit by road, rail, inland waterway, lift, elevator or air, among others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>2 Wheeler Insurance against damage or loss to the vehicle due to natural reasons</strong></h3>
<p>A two-wheeler insurance policy offers near comprehensive list of natural causes against which they offer protection to the insured. These include fire, explosion, lightning, earth-quake, flood, hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, storm, tempest, inundation, hailstorm, and landslide and rockslides, among others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>They insure against accidents to the riders</strong></h3>
<p>Two-wheeler insurance guards against any injuries to the rider and the co-passenger (if it is also there) from accidents. Most of these accidents result in medical costs of some kind or the other. The adverse effects of such costs can be mitigated with the help cover for personal accident.</p>
<p>They amount of payout depends on the type of damages suffered. In the unforeseen event of demise of the rider due to a mishap, the full amount of the cover is given to the nominees or family members. The amount is lesser in case of simple injuries from which the person can recover easily, with or without hospitalization (as mentioned in the document wording or documented wordings).</p>
<p>Policy wordings mention that the person is given compensation for injuries or death resulting from an accident to the vehicle due to violent, accidental, external and visible means. These accidents may occur when the person is travelling on the vehicle or is mounting from his motorbike, scooter or any other mechanized motorcycle. Check policy wording for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>They guard against bodily injuries to the third party</strong></h3>
<p>The policies guard against injuries caused to third parties due to an accident or incident that was caused by the insured motorcycle or scooter. There are instances when the vehicle may be at the center of an accident that causes injuries. These accidents may occur even when the driver was exercising extreme caution and riding the motorcycle as it is supposed to be ridden.</p>
<p>These events are unforeseen but may result in injuries to any party. The scooter insurance plans help to protect the insured party against any costs that they may have to incur due to accidental wears and tears. It ensures that the insured person does not suffer in any way because of an unforeseen event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>They insure against damages to third party property</strong></h3>
<p>Often an accident may result in damages to the property in surroundings. This raises legal responsibilities as the damages will have to be reimbursed by the insured person. Insurance comes to the rescue in such cases as the policy ensures that the insured does not suffer due to the loss suffered by the third party. The plans provide clear definite terms and limitations up to which the insurer will reimburse the affected person.</p>
<p>Nearly all of these wears and tears are settled through legal proceedings that ensure all actions are taken in strict accordance with the law of the country, and all causes and reimbursements are addressed in the manner prescribed under the statutes. The strict terms and conditions ensure that the insured does not suffer any loss due to events beyond their control, and the third party also receives the necessary compensation due to them as a result of the loss suffered by them due to the event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>They offer peace of mind</strong></h3>
<p>Motorcycles are generally purchased by young men and women and by the middle-class people in India. Whether it is Jammu and Kashmir or Andaman and Nicobar Islands, millions of these middle-class Indians use their motorcycles to commute from one place to another, for work or otherwise. For them, their motorbike, scooter, or moped is a means of their daily sustenance.</p>
<p>Even a small damage to their precious vehicle will mean rearranging the monthly household budget, and foregoing small pleasures to save on the costs incurred for repairing the motorbike. This policy works wonders for these people. It gives them a peace of mind as they don’t have to worry about how to pay for the expenditure. The insurance company will take care of these expenses for them, and they can ride easy, without any cause for worry.</p>

<p><strong>How to Renew a Two Wheeler Insurance or Bike Insurance Policy</strong></p>
<p>Renewing bike insurance online is quite easy and can be easily done. Nowadays, some companies are also tying up with mobile payment vendors and offering an easier way to make the payments and renew the plans. In addition, some of the more technologically advanced players have launched their own apps for their customers. People can easily download these apps on their smartphones and check and renew their plans using those dedicated apps. The insurance companies also offer old and trusted methods of renewal at their offices.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Online Renewal</strong></h3>
<p>You can go to the insurance company’s website and follow the steps laid down for two wheeler insurance online renewal. Makes sure all the data is correct and all contact and other personal details are up to date. Keep the old policy with you while you renew so you can refer to it for any details such as old policy number and so on.</p>
<p>Also, keep your debit cards or internet banking details handy so you can furnish the information when required. Most companies offer an information confirmation screen for their customers after they have entered the data and before they have furnished the premium payment details. Make good use of it and ensure all details are correct. Insurance companies generally generate a digital policy in the PDF format that does not require any person’s signature on confirmation of the premium payment. Save this PDF file in a secure location as you may need it later. Take a print out and keep it with your two wheeler documents that you keep with you when you ride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Using Mobile Apps</strong></h3>
<p>The process of renewing the plans using the dedicated mobile apps of the insurance companies or those of the mobile payment vendors is similar to the process of doing it online through the websites. Most of the apps will ask you to type in the information you need to fill in like the registration number, manufacturer’s name, model number and year, etc. of the two wheeler, and details of the policy like policy number, insurer’s name (if you are using a mobile payment vendor’s app), and so on.</p>
<p>Once you have keyed in the details, ensure you check this information thoroughly. This step of cross-checking the information becomes more important if you are using the mobile phone as the small screen size and the user interface may result in you missing out or wrongly filling in the information. Once the details are in place, agree with the terms and conditions and process the premium payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Branch Office Renewal</strong></h3>
<p>Renewing your insurance policy at the branch office is an old fashion way. The process is actually very simple though you have to find the time to go to the branch. You need to know your policy and vehicle details and fill the same in the application form.</p>
<p>The branch generally hands over the new policy immediately if you pay the premium by cash, demand draft or debit card. Cheque payments need time to clear and you get your policy later my mail at your address. A special thing to note here, the addition of new optional riders or add-on covers may require a visit to the branch. This varies from one insurance company to another and it will be good if you get this detail clarified before you include a newer optional cover.</p>
