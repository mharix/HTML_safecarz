<br><br><b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b><br> CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
 The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting 
personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
 those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa

and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
