<p>Car Insurance or motor insurance covers for losses that you might incur if your car gets damaged or stolen. The premium amount of your car insurance is decided on the basis of Insured Declared Value or IDV of the vehicle. If you increase the IDV, the premium rises and if you lower it, the premium reduces. It is important for any policyholder to compare various auto insurance options before going for a car insurance renewal or buying a new policy.</p>

<h2><strong><img src="images/cover.png" height="60px" width="50px" style="margin-bottom:-20px;">Coverage under Car Insurance</strong></h2>
<p><strong>There are primarily 3 types of Car Insurance -</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Third Party Liability Coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Third Party car insurance provides cover against any legal liability to a third party caused when you are at-fault driver. It covers damage/injury caused by you to another person/property. A Third Party Liability cover is legally mandatory in India under the Motor Vehicles Act.</p>
<h3><strong>Collision Coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Collision coverage protects the insured financially against damage of their own car. It pays the insured for damage caused by collision which is usually an accident. Damage or loss due to theft or vandalism is not included in collision coverage.</p>
<h3><strong>Comprehensive Coverage</strong></h3>
<p>A comprehensive coverage is extensive and includes damage of car, theft of vehicle, third party legal liability and personal accident cover. The policy coverage can be further extended by opting for add-ons like accessories cover, engine protector, zero depreciation cover, medical expenses, etc. This type of coverage is the most popular as it offers end-to-end coverage and thus less stress for the policyholder.</p>

<h2><strong><img src="images/plus.png" height="30px" width="30px" style="margin-bottom:-3px;">Customize Your Auto Insurance Policy with Additional Coverage</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>No Claim Bonus</strong></h3>
<p>For every claim free year, the insured is rewarded with discount on the renewal premium. This discount is called - No Claim Bonus (NCB). It is cumulative and increases, every year. It usually ranges from 10% to 50% and can save a substantial amount of money on the premium payable for your auto insurance. Let's take an example, if a policyholder doesn't make a claim during the tenure of his auto insurance policy, he becomes eligible for No Claim Bonus, on the basis of which, a certain rebate is offered on the payable premium.</p>
<p><a title="Car Insurance" href="#"><strong>Read More About No Claim Bonus</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Personal Accident Riders</strong></h3>
<p>Personal Accident Rider is an optional add-on benefit that can be added to the comprehensive auto insurance by paying an extra premium. This rider provides the policyholder with the coverage of medical expenses due to a damage, personal injury or disability caused due to an accident.</p>
<h3><strong>Cover for Car Accessories</strong></h3>
<p>By simply opting for separate add-on policy, you can avail the coverage for your car accessories, which a normal car insurance policy may not cover. Such additions may increase the premium, but it is always beneficial and cost-effective rather fitting a new car accessory.</p>
<h3><strong>Save Through Paying High Deductibles</strong></h3>
<p>A policyholder can save by paying higher deductibles. At the time of filing a claim, if you choose to pay higher deductibles against your claim, your auto insurance provider manages to give you some discount on premium later on.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong><img src="images/exclam.png" height="40px" width="40px" style="margin-bottom:-2px;">What is not covered in Car Insurance?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Following features are usually not covered in car insurance:</strong></p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Loss or damage if a policy is not in force.</li>
<li>Gradual wear and tear of car and its parts.</li>
<li>Loss or damage to vehicle when driven by person without a valid driving license.</li>
<li>Loss or damage to vehicle as a result of intoxication due to drugs, alcohol etc.</li>
<li>Loss or damage to engine as a result of oil leakage.</li>
<li>Loss or damage to vehicle as a result of abuse of car manufacturer's guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><strong><img src="images/doc.png" height="50px" width="50px" style="margin-bottom:-10px;">Eligibility/Documentation Required for Car Insurance</strong></h2>
<p>Getting a car insured requires minimal documentation. For a new policy, you must submit the filled up proposal form and copy of the Registration Certificate (RC). For renewals, you will need copy of the RC (Registration Certificate) along with the copy of previous insurance policy.</p>
<p>Carefully fill in your complete details. This is an important step and will save you a lot of hassle during claim time.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong><img src="images/discount.png" height="50px" width="50px" style="margin-bottom:-10px;">Get Discounts, Save Money, Buy Smart</strong></h2>
<p>A smart customer is in a constant hunt for discounts which will reduce the burden on his pocket. If you are one among them then here are a few tips that will help you get discount and save money on premium value of your car insurance.</p>
<h3><strong>Voluntary Access</strong></h3>
<p>Voluntary deductible is the minimum amount that you declare to bear at the time of claim. The higher deductible you opt for, the lower will be your premium. Simply put it means that the financial burden on the insurance provider is less and you will also chip in when an accident or car damage happens.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><img src="images/discount.png" height="25px" width="25px" style="margin-bottom:-2px;">Anti-theft Discount</strong></h3>
<p>In case your car is fitted with an ARAI approved anti theft device, your insurer will offer additional discount (2.5% on the OD Premium). This discount is provided for the simple reason that an anti-theft device will make your car less liable to theft.</p>
<h3><strong>Privilege Membership</strong></h3>
<p>Members of the Automobile Association and some Professionals (Defense Personnel, Doctors and Govt. Employees) are entitled to get additional discount on their premium. So, never miss out to mention the same while searching for a quote.</p>
<p>While getting quotes for your vehicle at Policy Bazaar, you might see for yourself how changing even minor details make a huge difference to the final calculated premium. For example, take the case of Dr. Gupta. He's a doctor by profession and needs car insurance for his brand new Renault Duster. His car is fitted with an ARAI approved anti-theft kit. While getting a car insurance quote, he neither mentions his profession nor the fact that his car is fitted with an anti-theft kit. Thus he ends up paying a higher premium. On the contrary, if he did mention about these then, needless to say, his premium could have been lower by 25%.</p>
<p>Always fill in your correct and complete details while getting comparative Quotes from Policy Bazaar.</p>
